It might seem quite strange: why am I creating another blog for myself when I already have a [personal blog here](https://inquivision.com/)?

Part of this is due to the feeling of discomfort I get from the friction of using Wordpress as a CMS. 

Part of it is the feeling of wonder when I use [Github](https://www.github.com) on the command-line, together with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): it is just so easy to write in Obsidian, especially after I've gotten used to Markdown. 

So I am experimenting with this blog, to see if it's possible to generate a smooth & seamless writing workflow.
